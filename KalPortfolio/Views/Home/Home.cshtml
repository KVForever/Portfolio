                                My love of technology has guided me and led me to where I am today. I always wanted to help in the creation of new and exciting technologies, and I can do this by combining my love of technoligy with a passion for solving problems to create impactful software.

                            <p>
                                Heartland, the start of my professional development, is an experience that I will look back upon with shock when I reflect on how early I got involved in the industry.
                                At the age of 16 I am able to learn about current technologies and learn about even more than just technical skills.
                                I practice communication skills threw collaborations with coworkers to solve different problems.
                                I am able to learn about how to better interact with coworkers threw standups and mixer meetings.
                                The list goes on but the importance for my employment at Heartland was to experience what it would be like to work as a software engineer and ultimately if this is something I could do as a career.
                                Currently this is a very feasible career path for myself.

                                Marcus was my first job and will always be viewed warmly.
                                I got a job at the movie theater because my options where very scarce at 15 years old.
                                Even so this was a great choice. I was able to gain customer experience which ultimately means I learned how to resolve conflict and anticipate the needs of others.
                                I am know able to use what I learned to better understand the needs of employers and to go a step beyond what is asked of me.
                                I am also able to improve my leadership skills as a Shift Lead.
                                I am in charge of making sure that concessions is running smoothly.
                                Tasks include making sure that all items are stocked, customers conflicts get resolved efficiently and correctly, retrieve cash for drawers if necessary, and instruct coworkers on correct procedures among other tasks.

                                I earned one bronze badge for the 2021-2022 year and a bronze and silver badge for the 2022-2023 year.

                                As a member of Student Council I help to organize events that take place at my school.
                                From prom to penny wars to pep-rallies I help to make them run smoothly as possible adding valuable input where I can. Through my time in student council I have learned to present ideas in an attractive manner and have learned more about how to work on a team.

                        Currently my projects are all about learning. Through tutorials I can learn about new technologies and concepts in a more formal and organized manner.
                        After being able to learn about these technologies projects I create on my own can be used to explore what I learned in my own way, confirm my understanding of the technology, and gain experience with the given technology.
                        The following projects let me do what I just have stated and provide me not only with experience but a sense of pride when I am able to implement what I learned in a new way that I had not known how to previously.
